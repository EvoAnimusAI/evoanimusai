- They belong to the class of metaheuristics and are a subset of population based bio-inspired algorithms[1] and evolutionary computation, which itself are part of the field of computational intelligence
- [2] The mechanisms of biological evolution that an EA mainly imitates are reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection
